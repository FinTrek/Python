Python code from courses and or examples
Great Udemy intro course https://www.udemy.com/python-coding/learn/v4/content
Highly recommended 
Kirill Eremenko does a really good job of getting your feet wet, teaching you to get things up and running and challenging your 
thinking. The course is accessible for both beginners and experienced IT folk that have other coding experience and want a primer 
to get started with Python.
